This paper uses {KNN} ({K-NearestNeighbor}) and Random Sample Consensus ({RANSAC}) to the three methods inorder to analyze the results of the methods' application in recognition. {KNN} isused to find the matches, and {RANSAC} to reject inconsistent matches fromwhich the inliers can take as correct matches. The performance of the robustfeature detection methods are compared for scale changes, rotation, blur,illumination changes and affine transformations.
