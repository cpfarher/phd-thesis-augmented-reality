  abstract = {The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of ?-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.},

  abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class
	of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling,
	translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination
	changes and affine or 3D projection.These features share similar
	properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used
	for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently
	detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable
	points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local
	geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in
	multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales.The keys are used
	as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate
	object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding
	a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters.
	Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved
	in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of
	under 2 seconds.},
